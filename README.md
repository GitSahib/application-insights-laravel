# Microsoft Application Insights for Laravel 10+
A simple Laravel integration for Microsoft Application Insights

This package was originally inspired by provisions-group/ms-application-insights-laravel. That package was built for Laravel 5 and is no longer maintained.

This package is a fully maintained, standalone implementation for Laravel 10+, updated to support the latest Application Insights requirements. It provides a clean way to push telemetry from your Laravel web app and APIs directly to Application Insights, with additional features such as queue support and separate handling for API and web guards.

## Installation

Update the `require` section of your application's **composer.json** file:

```js
"require": {
	...
	"larasahib/application-insights-laravel": "1.2.0",
	...
}
```

## Instrumentation Key / Connection String

The package will check your application's `.env` file for your **Instrumentation Key**.

⚠ **Note:**
`MS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY` is **deprecated**.
Use `MS_AI_CONNECTION_STRING` instead.

### `.env` example

```env
# Old way (deprecated)
# MS_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

# New way (recommended)
MS_AI_CONNECTION_STRING=InstrumentationKey=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000;IngestionEndpoint=https://<region>.in.applicationinsights.azure.com/
```

### Where to find the connection string

You can get the connection string from your Azure Portal:

```
Application Insights → Overview → Connection String
```

You can find your instrumentation key on the [Microsoft Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

Navigate to:

**Microsoft Azure** > **Browse** > **Application Insights** > *(Application Name)* > **Settings** > **Properties**

## Usage

### Request Tracking Middleware

To monitor your application's performance with request tracking, add the middleware to your in your application, found in **app/Http/Kernel.php**. It has to be added after the StartSession middleware has been added.

```php

protected $middleware = [
	'api':
		...
		'AppInsightsApiMiddleware',
		...
	'web':
		...
		'AppInsightsWebMiddleware',
		...
]

```

The request will send the following additional properties to Application Insights:

- **ajax** *(boolean)*: *true* if the request is an AJAX request
- **ip** *(string)*: The client's IP address
- **pjax** *(boolean)*: *true* if the request is a PJAX request
- **secure** *(boolean)*: *true* if the request was sent over HTTPS
- **route** *(string)*: The name of the route, if applicable
- **user** *(integer)*: The ID of the logged in user, if applicable
- **referer** *(string)*: The HTTP_REFERER value from the request, if available

The middleware is also used to estimate the time that a user has spent on a particular page.  This is sent as a *trace* event named **browse_duration**.

### Exception Handler

To report exceptions that occur in your application, use the provided exception handler.  *Replace* the following line in your application's **app/Handlers/Exception.php** file:

```php
...

# Delete this line
use Illuminate\Foundation\Exceptions\Handler as ExceptionHandler;

# Insert this line
use Larasahib\AppInsightsLaravel\Handlers\AppInsightsExceptionHandler as ExceptionHandler;

...
```

The exception handler will send additional properties to Application Insights, as above.

### Client Side

In order to register page view information from the client with Application Insights, simply insert the following code into your Blade views:

```php
{!! \AIClient::javascript() !!}
```

NOTE: Microsoft recommend that you put the script in the `<head>` section of your pages, in order to calculate the fullest extent of page load time on the client.

### Custom

If you want to use any of the underlying [ApplicationInsights-PHP](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-PHP) functionality, you can call the methods directly from the server facade:

```php
...
\AIServer::trackEvent('Test event');
\AIServer::flush();//immediate send
\AIQueue::dispatch(\AIServer::getChannel()->getQueue())->delay(now()->addSeconds(3));//use laravel queue to send data later
...
```

## Publishing the Package Configuration and Assets

After installing the package, you need to publish the configuration file and JavaScript assets so your application can use them:

1. **Publish the configuration:**

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config
```

This will copy the `AppInsightsLaravel.php` configuration file to your app’s `config` folder.

### 2. **Publish the JavaScript assets**

Although Laravel 10+ users will have the assets automatically available after install or update via Composer, you can also manually publish them if needed:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-assets
```

This ensures the JS file is copied to your `public/vendor/appinsights/js` folder and ready to be loaded by the client. 

  > **Tip:** Add `--force` to overwrite existing files if needed.

## Release Notes

### v1.2.1 (January 26, 2026)
- **Fix for Empty Properties:** Fixed an issue where telemetry was rejected when properties were empty. These are now correctly cast to objects to ensure proper JSON serialization (`{}` instead of `[]`).
- **Improved Request Context in Exceptions:** Added a fallback to capture request data using the Laravel `request()` helper when the request object is missing from the exception's stack trace, which is common in production environments.

### v1.2.0 (January 19, 2026)
- **Production Reporting Fix:** Fixed an issue where exceptions were not reported when the application was in production mode.
- **Centralized Logging:** Refactored logging to use a centralized `Logger` class that respects the `enable_local_logging` configuration.
- **Improved Exception Tracing:** Updated `trackException` to properly capture and merge request context and custom properties.
- **Stability Enhancements:** Improved robustness of the telemetry flush mechanism and fixed potential runtime exceptions related to missing configuration.
- **Cleanup:** Removed redundant logging and improved code readability.
